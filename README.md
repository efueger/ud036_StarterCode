Source code for a Movie Trailer website.

Forked from Udacity's [Movie project](https://github.com/udacity/ud036_StarterCode): this python code populates a webpage with a few of my favorite movies.
- in addition to the code, I'm incorporating Code Climate analysis, which produces [these results](https://codeclimate.com/github/efueger/ud036_StarterCode).

Code Climate checks enabled:
- PEP8

Install
--------
Clone the project to your local system:
```git clone https://github.com/efueger/ud036_StarterCode.git```


Usage
------
Want Python to work it's magic and open a webpage with fancy movie art and previews?
- Use IDLE, sublime, or your favorite tool, run Python in the `entertainment_center.py` file. (In sublime, it's as easy as using `cmd` + `b`.)

Want to edit the list with _your_ favorite flicks? Check out the `entertainment_center.py` file for formatting.

The general format is:

```
_your_movie_ = media.Movie(
    "_title_",
    "_poster image_,
    "_trailer url_",
    "_genre_"
    )
```



Supported Python versions
